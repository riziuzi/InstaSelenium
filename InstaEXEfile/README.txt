Hey!

1) Check your chrome version (Hope you use chrome browser)
	
	a) open chrome broswer and click the three horizontal dots for more options
	b) Help > About Chrome > Version     (   mine was - 103.0.5060.66 (Official Build) (64-bit)   ) 

2) Now if your chrome version is same as mine i.e. 103.0.5060.66, then you're all ready. Go use the program.
   But if you don't then follow few of the below steps and get it done : 
	
	a) go to this link                     --      https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

	b) dowload your version of ChromeDriver   (example: for windows    --    	chromedriver_win32.zip)

     *c) Imp: Extract the downloaded file (chromedriver app.) in THIS SAME DIRECTORY(FOLDER). Don't forget to delete the previous chromedriver application.




All done!
